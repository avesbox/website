What is Avesbox? Why has it been created?
In this post I will answer to all these questions and more. üê§

## What is Avesbox?

Avesbox is a Dart ecosystem that aims to unleash the power of Dart on the backend by providing a set of libraries and tools to build web applications, APIs, and more.

Right now the project is composed of the following packages:

- [Serinus](https://pub.dev/packages/serinus): a modular framework to build web applications and APIs.
- [Acanthis](https://pub.dev/packages/acanthis): a library to validate and parse data inspired by Zod.
- [Frontier](https://pub.dev/packages/frontier): a library that exposes a set of strategies to handle authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs.
- [Secure Session](https://pub.dev/packages/secure_session): a library to handle sessions securely in web applications and APIs.

## Why has Avesbox been created?

Avesbox has been created when I started to understand the lack of libraries and tools to build web applications, communicate with services and more in Dart.

So I decided to create a set of libraries and tools to fill this gap and to demonstrate that Dart is a powerful language that can be used also on the backend and not only for Flutter.

## What are the goals of Avesbox?

The main goals of Avesbox are:

- Create a complete ecosystem to build web applications and APIs in Dart.
- Create a community around the project to help each other and to grow together.
- Demonstrate that Dart is a powerful language that can be used also on the backend and not only for Flutter.

## Conclusion

Although Avesbox has been created by one person and it is still in its early stages, I believe that it has a great potential and I hope that it become a reference point for the Dart community to build web applications and APIs.
