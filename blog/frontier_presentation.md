Have you ever had to deal with Firebase Auth and it's amazing policy about refresh tokens? Or maybe you prefer Auth0 but you don't like the idea of going broke because of the pricing? Or perhaps your boss asked you to validate some cognito tokens and you don't know where to start? I feel you, but don't worry! I have a solution for you!

Have you ever heard of Frontier? No? Well, let me introduce you to this amazing library!

## What is Frontier?

Well thanks for asking! Frontier is a Dart library that provides a set of strategies to handle authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs. It is designed to be flexible and easy to use, allowing you to integrate it into your existing Dart projects with minimal effort.

Frontier uses the very popular Strategy design pattern to provide a clean and extensible API (Have you ever heard of Passport.js? It's like this, but for Dart).

## Is it easy to use?

Of course! Frontier is designed to be easy to use and integrate with your app. You can get started with Frontier in just a few simple steps:

1. Add the Frontier package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Create an instance of the `Frontier` class.
3. Register the strategies you want to use.
4. Use the `authenticate` method to authenticate users.
5. Use the callback function to handle the result of the authentication.
6. Done!

## Why should I use Frontier?

Frontier offers several benefits that make it a great choice for handling user authentication in your Dart applications:

- **Flexibility**: Frontier is designed to be flexible and easy to integrate with your existing projects.
- **Extensibility**: You can easily create custom strategies to handle authentication and authorization in your app and since each strategy is identified by a unique name, you can use multiple strategies in the same project.
- **Security**: By using Frontier, you won't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to user authentication. Frontier provides a set of secure strategies that you can use out of the box.
- **Community**: Frontier is part of the Avesbox ecosystem and is actively maintained.

## Conclusion

Frontier is a powerful library that can help you streamline user authentication in your Dart applications. It is designed to be flexible, easy to use, and secure, making it a great choice for handling authentication and authorization in your projects.
